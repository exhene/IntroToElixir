# IntroToElixir

Elixir is a dynamic, functional programming language built on top of the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM). It was designed to be scalable, fault-tolerant, and easily extensible, making it well-suited for building distributed and concurrent systems.

Elixir is inspired by the syntax and conventions of Ruby, but it is not a pure object-oriented language. Instead, it supports functional programming concepts such as immutability and pattern matching, and it provides powerful concurrency primitives, such as processes and message passing, that allow developers to build highly concurrent and fault-tolerant systems.

Elixir also includes a comprehensive standard library with modules for data manipulation, networking, web development, and more, and it has a growing ecosystem of third-party libraries and tools that make it easier to build and deploy production-ready applications.
